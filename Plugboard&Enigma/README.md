An R program to implement a simplified version of the Enigma machine, "little Enigma." The first function, `plugboard()`, randomly chooses a 5-digit passocde and randomly configures the plugboard of the Enigma machine by randomly pairing letters from the alphabet together. The second function, `l_enigma()`, encodes/decodes a message given a passcode and a plugboard configuration.
